				<h2>My Tokyo 2020 Predictions</h2>

							Even though 2016 still feels like yesterday, Olympic hopefuls have been diligently counting the days until Tokyo 2020. For the Unites States men, Brady Ellison is a household name that appears on podiums year after year, and to no surprise, will attend his fourth Olympics this summer. In Rio 2016, Ellison was the individual Bronze medalist and a team Silver medalist. His 2019 outdoor season was nothing short of remarkable. A new, seemingly unattainable world record of 702/720, multiple stage wins, and World Archery Champion to top it off. If we are going off recent memory, Brady Ellison is an obvious choice for an Olympic podium this cycle. The USA once again has a young hopeful in the Recurve Men's division, 20-year-old Jack Williams. I've known him since JDT Selection Camp in 2014, and he now attends the Resident Athlete program in Chula Vista, California. He has not stopped improving since I first met him, and has recently bested Brady Ellison in a few head-to-head matchups. However, the US Men's bread and butter -the team round- is not looking too hopeful this Olympic cycle. They are clearly missing a clear third option, and with only two consistent elite performers, their medal hopes are slim in the Team rounds. This weakness in the USA's third option is only highlighted by the rapidly rising Chinese Taipei men's team and the legendary, consistent, year after year performance of the Korean men's team. The Korean men took the Gold in Rio 2016, and are very well-positioned to defend their title. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							On the other side of the line, the US women also appear to have a promising new hope in 15-year-old Casey Kaufhold. She is ranked #1 in the US, above seasoned Olympic veterans Mackenzie Brown and Khatuna Lorig. Kaufhold has recently broken countless national and world Junior records, with many more to come. However, the US women as a whole have struggled in international competition. The women are unlikely to qualify for a full 3-person Olympic squad, and will likely send Kaufhold alone. While Kaufhold is relatively untested on the international stage, her outings have been impressive and show great potential. However, at 15, she has no Olympic experience, and we can only observe how she adapts her mental game to this pressure.

							Although I am in self-proclaimed "retirement" from competitive archery, I have been eyeing a comeback for quite some time. There are no excuses from here on out- I have finally managed to find a way to practice on campus, which is a true game-changer. Getting those consistent reps in has helped me stay in shape enough to shoot my heavy competition bow. I am still shooting my tried and true Win&Win setup dating back to the 2014 US Open. In fact, dating back two days before the US Open. In 2014 I had only been shooting for under a year and did not have the simple wisdom to not buy a bow and redo my entire setup and tune two days before the biggest competition of the year. All I remember was not shooting well the week before the competition. Instead of looking to my form for the fix, I decided something was wrong with the bow I had at the time (it was fine).  
						</p>
						<p> 
							Since I am looking to compete in smaller local shoots, for the time being, I am taking this extended break period to work on my form and physical strength/endurance. While I can tell that my form has floated around throughout the years, I can still use my own proprioception to make subtle changes. I've also watched enough televised archery to pick apart any archer's form and apply it to my own. Currently, I am recommitting to my fundamentals. I've noticed that my fingers hooking the string have a tendency to loosen up as I draw the bow. As the hook becomes shallower, I have to put more tension on my fingers to keep the string from slipping away. If I can fix this issue permanently, I can have a more relaxed and consistent draw hand. Also, I'm hoping to work on my clicker reflex, which I have managed to get away with for my entire archery career. Most archers have conditioned their clicker response so that it isn't a full reflex. In other words, when they draw through the clicker, they have the presence of mind to either a. subconsciously execute their release or b. abort the shot and let down. However, I have let releasing when the clicker clicks become a reflex burned into my mind for six years.

				<h2>What is the NTS method?</h2>

							The National Training System, or NTS, is a shooting technique devised by USA Archery Head Coach KiSik Lee, is widely adopted in the US amongst all ages and skill levels. NTS is centered around using biomechanical efficiency principles to minimize the bow's effect on the archer. As a matter of fact, NTS was previously known as BEST (Biomechanically Efficient Shooting Technique) before it was canonized nationally. KiSik Lee and his adopters have had great international success using the NTS method. Lee's first major project was the Australian Simon Fairweather, who adopted NTS before it was legitimized. Fairweather went on to win the gold in his hometown Sydney 2000 Olympics. The recent world record holder, 4x World Archery Champion, and Olympic bronze medalist Brady Ellison also trains directly with Lee through the resident athlete program. NTS is not widely adopted around the world. At most international stages, NTS is often seen as 'the American technique'.
						</p>
						<p> 
							The basis of NTS's biomechanical efficiency is using the archer's bone structure and back muscles to brace the weight of the bow. Aligning the archer's bone structure is paramount in any archery discipline, not just NTS. To achieve this, the archer must align their bow wrist, bow elbow, both shoulders and draw elbow in a perfect line that points at the target downrange. With all major bones in the system aligned, the force of the bow is braced by the bones instead of the muscles. This allows the relevant muscles to relax and allow the archer to execute a clean shot. The hallmark of NTS is direct, active back muscle engagement on the draw side of the archer. While other techniques use the lower and middle trapezi as supporting peripheral muscles, NTS encourages archers to actively engage and contract those muscles to expand through the clicker. The aim of using the back muscles is so that the archer can relax the muscles in their draw arm, shoulder, and fingers. The process of redistributing the draw tension in an archer's body from the draw arm to the back muscles is dubbed 'transfer'. Once again, relaxation of the muscles in the draw arm and fingers allows for a cleaner release and therefore a more accurate shot. According to Lee, an added bonus of this technique is that it allows the archer to expand through the clicker without changing the tension in their draw arm. Instead, the archer expands through the clicker exclusively with their back muscles, with the draw arm tension remains constant. While it is important to have minimal tension in the draw arm and fingers, it is even more important for that tension (however much) to be consistent every time. This is the only way to have consistent groups downrange. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As I discussed before, the biomechanical principles of NTS can be seen in other techniques as well. But what makes NTS so distinctive? How can experienced archers instantly tell if you have been training with KiSik Lee? The answer to this question is an angular draw. The principles of using the bone structure and back tension refer only to when the archer is at full draw, right before they are about to release the arrow. Angular draw refers to the way in which the archer reaches this position. This is by way the most distinctive yet controversial feature of NTS. In conventional shooting methods (Korean Push-Pull), the 'bone line' is mostly formed before the archer lifts the bow. Then, the archer pulls the bow straight back (linear draw) to their anchor point. However, linear draw puts the archer's draw shoulder in a very awkward position. At high draw weights (45lb+) and elite level daily arrow counts (500+), this is a recipe for eventual rotator cuff injury. So, Lee's idea of angular draw appears to solve this problem. The archer begins with his shoulders wide to the target, the 'bone line' not very well-formed at the beginning of the shot. However, as the archer is drawing, the entire upper torso is rotated into alignment. This 'coiling' during the draw instead of before protects the shoulder and is supposed to eliminate must rotator cuff injuries. However, I can only speculate on why this technique is not adopted universally. Firstly, the coiling motion during the draw is directly counteractive to archery's core tenet: consistency. An archer shooting linear technique knows his shoulders are aligned the same way every shot. However, another archer using angular draw must rotate his shoulders exactly the same amount each shot. This is considerably harder to master and can create draw length inconsistencies, devastating to a recurve archer. Another glaring flaw is that NTS appears to need more effort/tension to draw the bow. This flaw counteracts the whole point of NTS: making shooting easier on the body. Rotating the upper torso while keeping the hips in place creates a lot of tension in the core. Tension in the core easily translates to the arms and shoulders, creating a tight and forced shot. For this reason, the NTS method, unfortunately, appears to have limited success with smaller female athletes. The US women have been struggling to put out a true international competitor for many years since adopting NTS as the national standard. The US's two top female prospects (who use NTS) in recent years are Mackenzie Brown and Khatuna Lorig, 5x Olympian (Georgia). Both these women are incredibly strong, pulling more draw weight than the male average in the Olympics. Both Brown and Lorig also have very long draw lengths, especially Brown at 5'10". The current top-ranked female in the US, Casey Kaufhold, shoots a relaxed, hybrid style more reminiscent of push-pull than American NTS.

				<h2>What is the Push-Pull method?</h2>

							While the push-pull method and its subvariants are widely used throughout the world, its true patron is Korea. Korea has dominated the archery world since a women's gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, where legendary coach Hyung-tak Kim took control of the Korean archery program. His method is also unmistakable. The archer is encouraged to push the bow with their bow hand while simultaneously pulling with the other, creating a sort of 50/50 balance. This balance results in stability and ultimately consistency downrange. While his archers use a linear draw, they still manage to achieve perfect alignment and peripheral back engagement. Interestingly, his students have long careers without any repeating rotator cuff injuries. Perhaps the greatest property of Korean push-pull shooters is the strict beauty of their forms. The Korean archery program is notoriously unforgiving and therefore produces archers with the most technically correct and visually appealing techniques in the world. It is said that making the Korean national team is far more difficult than a podium finish on the international stage. A prime example is in the most important part of the shot: the release. Renowned Korean names such as Kim Woojin and Ki-Bo-Bae (pictured) are synonymous with the crispest and picturesque releases in memory. Their fingers, while holding in excess of 45lbs of draw weight, appear to release the string effortlessly and without any tension. Ki's fingers don't appear to open at all unless you watch in 1000fps slow motion.	 
						</p>
						<p> 
							While the Korean archery technique is simpler and easier to learn at first, most of their teachings focus on the archer's internal state. The subtle tensions, balances, and mindsets that are impossible to discern without communicating with the archer. So, I view push-pull as a technique that is easy to learn but takes 10 years (10,000) hours of training to begin to master. With push-pull archers, more emphasis is put on the mental game (software over hardware) during competitions. Kim Woojin, the previous world record holder, called his shot in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The year before that Olympics, he proclaimed that he would best the then-world-record of 699/720. During the qualification round, he scored 700/720. I would imagine that Kim accomplished this Jordan-esque feat through a strict regimen of visualization, and self-affirmation work. However, the premier training techniques of Korea are a well-kept secret to their top private clubs and national programs. This only adds to the mystique of the highly imposing and accomplished Korean archery team.

			<div> <strong><em>About Me</em></strong>
				<p>
					I'm 20 years old out of New Jersey, currently a University student. I've been a competitive archer for 6 years and coaching for a good portion of that time. I shoot and write about the Olympic regulation archery style, recurve archery. I've been fortunate enough to have the support from my coach, my Dad, and my friends to win multiple national titles and to have been ranked as high as 10th in the USA. With my busy university schedule, I am only shooting casually now, with an emphasis on coaching. Currently, I am a USA Archery Level 2 Coach, taking the pleasure of coaching my Dad's students whenever I'm on break.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div> <strong><em>My Club, My Coaches</em></strong>
				<p>
					I began and continue my archery career at a small local club in New Jersey called Wa-Xo-Be archers. It is an indoor range designed to shoot indoor regulation distance. The range and club itself has a rich history with many founding members still involved. I was lucky enough to have excellent coaching from the beginning of my journey. Coach John is a USA Archery Certified Level 4 Coach and has been through every step of the way for me. My Dad has provided indescribable support through my entire archery career. He has become equally invested in archery, taking on multiple students and has become very well-respected in the local community.
