					While the push-pull method and its subvariants are widely used throughout the world, its true patron is Korea. Korea has dominated the archery world since a women's gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, where legendary coach Hyung-tak Kim took control of the Korean archery program. His method is also unmistakable. The archer is encouraged to push the bow with their bow hand while simultaneously pulling with the other, creating a sort of 50/50 balance. This balance results in stability and ultimately consistency downrange. While his archers use a linear draw, they still manage to achieve perfect alignment and peripheral back engagement. Interestingly, his students have long careers without any repeating rotator cuff injuries. Perhaps the greatest property of Korean push-pull shooters is the strict beauty of their forms. The Korean archery program is notoriously unforgiving and therefore produces archers with the most technically correct and visually appealing techniques in the world. It is said that making the Korean national team is far more difficult than a podium finish on the international stage. A prime example is in the most important part of the shot: the release. Renowned Korean names such as Kim Woojin and Ki-Bo-Bae (pictured) are synonymous with the crispest and picturesque releases in memory. Their fingers, while holding in excess of 45lbs of draw weight, appear to release the string effortlessly and without any tension. Ki's fingers don't appear to open at all unless you watch in 1000fps slow motion.

					While the Korean archery technique is simpler and easier to learn at first, most of their teachings focus on the archer's internal state. The subtle tensions, balances, and mindsets that are impossible to discern without communicating with the archer. So, I view push-pull as a technique that is easy to learn but takes 10 years (10,000) hours of training to begin to master. With push-pull archers, more emphasis is put on the mental game (software over hardware) during competitions. Kim Woojin, the previous world record holder, called his shot in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The year before that Olympics, he proclaimed that he would best the then-world-record of 699/720. During the qualification round, he scored 700/720. I would imagine that Kim accomplished this Jordan-esque feat through a strict regimen of visualization, and self-affirmation work. However, the premier training techniques of Korea are a well-kept secret to their top private clubs and national programs. This only adds to the mystique of the highly imposing and accomplished Korean archery team.

					The National Training System, or NTS, is a shooting technique devised by USA Archery Head Coach KiSik Lee, is widely adopted in the US amongst all ages and skill levels. NTS is centered around using biomechanical efficiency principles to minimize the bow's effect on the archer. As a matter of fact, NTS was previously known as BEST (Biomechanically Efficient Shooting Technique) before it was canonized nationally. KiSik Lee and his adopters have had great international success using the NTS method. Lee's first major project was the Australian Simon FairweatherHowever, who adopted NTS before it was legitimized. Fairweather went on to win the gold in his hometown Sydney 2000 Olympics. The recent world record holder, 4x World Archery Champion, and Olympic bronze medalist Brady Ellison also trains directly with Lee through the resident athlete program. NTS is not widely adopted around the world. At most international stages, NTS is often seen as 'the American technique'.

					The basis of NTS's biomechanical efficiency is using the archer's bone structure and back muscles to brace the weight of the bow. Aligning the archer's bone structure is paramount in any archery discipline, not just NTS. To achieve this, the archer must align their bow wrist, bow elbow, both shoulders and draw elbow in a perfect line that points at the target downrange. With all major bones in the system aligned, the force of the bow is braced by the bones instead of the muscles. This allows the relevant muscles to relax and allow the archer to execute a clean shot. The hallmark of NTS is direct, active back muscle engagement on the draw side of the archer. While other techniques use the lower and middle trapezi as supporting peripheral muscles, NTS encourages archers to actively engage and contract those muscles to expand through the clicker. The aim of using the back muscles is so that the archer can relax the muscles in their draw arm, shoulder, and fingers. The process of redistributing the draw tension in an archer's body from the draw arm to the back muscles is dubbed 'transfer'. Once again, relaxation of the muscles in the draw arm and fingers allows for a cleaner release and therefore a more accurate shot. According to Lee, an added bonus of this technique is that it allows the archer to expand through the clicker without changing the tension in their draw arm. Instead, the archer expands through the clicker exclusively with their back muscles, with the draw arm tension remains constant. While it is important to have minimal tension in the draw arm and fingers, it is even more important for that tension (however much) to be consistent every time. This is the only way to have consistent groups downrange.

					As I discussed before, the biomechanical principles of NTS can be seen in other techniques as well. But what makes NTS so distinctive? How can experienced archers instantly tell if you have been training with KiSik Lee? The answer to this question is an angular draw. The principles of using the bone structure and back tension refer only to when the archer is at full draw, right before they are about to release the arrow. Angular draw refers to the way in which the archer reaches this position. This is by way the most distinctive yet controversial feature of NTS. In conventional shooting methods (Korean Push-Pull), the 'bone line' is mostly formed before the archer lifts the bow. Then, the archer pulls the bow straight back (linear draw) to their anchor point. However, linear draw puts the archer's draw shoulder in a very awkward position. At high draw weights (45lb+) and elite level daily arrow counts (500+), this is a recipe for eventual rotator cuff injury. So, Lee's idea of angular draw appears to solve this problem. The archer begins with his shoulders wide to the target, the 'bone line' not very well-formed at the beginning of the shot. However, as the archer is drawing, the entire upper torso is rotated into alignment. This 'coiling' during the draw instead of before protects the shoulder and is supposed to eliminate must rotator cuff injuries. However, I can only speculate on why this technique is not adopted universally. Firstly, the coiling motion during the draw is directly counteractive to archery's core tenet: consistency. An archer shooting linear technique knows his shoulders are aligned the same way every shot. However, another archer using angular draw must rotate his shoulders exactly the same amount each shot. This is considerably harder to master and can create draw length inconsistencies, devastating to a recurve archer. Another glaring flaw is that NTS appears to need more effort/tension to draw the bow. This flaw counteracts the whole point of NTS: making shooting easier on the body. Rotating the upper torso while keeping the hips in place creates a lot of tension in the core. Tension in the core easily translates to the arms and shoulders, creating a tight and forced shot. For this reason, the NTS method, unfortunately, appears to have limited success with smaller female athletes. The US women have been struggling to put out a true international competitor for many years since adopting NTS as the national standard. The US's two top female prospects (who use NTS) in recent years are Mackenzie Brown and Khatuna Lorig, 5x Olympian (Georgia). Both these women are incredibly strong, pulling more draw weight than the male average in the Olympics. Both Brown and Lorig also have very long draw lengths, especially Brown at 5'10". The current top-ranked female in the US, Casey Kaufhold, shoots a relaxed, hybrid style more reminiscent of push-pull than American NTS.

					Although I am in self-proclaimed "retirement" from competitive archery, I have been eyeing a comeback for quite some time. There are no excuses from here on out- I have finally managed to find a way to practice on campus, which is a true game-changer. Getting those consistent reps in has helped me stay in shape enough to shoot my heavy competition bow. I am still shooting my tried and true Win&Win setup dating back to the 2014 US Open. In fact, dating back two days before the US Open. In 2014 I had only been shooting for under a year and did not have the simple wisdom to not buy a bow and redo my entire setup and tune two days before the biggest competition of the year. All I remember was not shooting well the week before the competition. Instead of looking to my form for the fix, I decided something was wrong with the bow I had at the time (it was fine). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Since I am looking to compete in smaller local shoots, for the time being, I am taking this extended break period to work on my form and physical strength/endurance. While I can tell that my form has floated around throughout the years, I can still use my own proprioception to make subtle changes. I've also watched enough televised archery to pick apart any archer's form and apply it to my own. Currently, I am recommitting to my fundamentals. I've noticed that my fingers hooking the string have a tendency to loosen up as I draw the bow. As the hook becomes shallower, I have to put more tension on my fingers to keep the string from slipping away. If I can fix this issue permanently, I can have a more relaxed and consistent draw hand. Also, I'm hoping to work on my clicker reflex, which I have managed to get away with for my entire archery career. Most archers have conditioned their clicker response so that it isn't a full reflex. In other words, when they draw through the clicker, they have the presence of mind to either a. subconsciously execute their release or b. abort the shot and let down. However, I have let releasing when the clicker clicks become a reflex burned into my mind for six years.
