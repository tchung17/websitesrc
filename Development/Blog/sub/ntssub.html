                The National Training System, or NTS, is a shooting technique devised by USA Archery Head Coach KiSik Lee, is widely adopted in the US amongst all ages and skill levels. NTS is centered around using biomechanical efficiency principles to minimize the bow's effect on the archer. As a matter of fact, NTS was previously known as BEST (Biomechanically Efficient Shooting Technique) before it was canonized nationally. KiSik Lee and his adopters have had great international success using the NTS method. Lee's first major project was the Australian Simon Fairweather, who adopted NTS before it was legitimized. Fairweather went on to win the gold in his hometown Sydney 2000 Olympics. The recent world record holder, 4x World Archery Champion, and Olympic bronze medalist Brady Ellison also trains directly with Lee through the resident athlete program. NTS is not widely adopted around the world. At most international stages, NTS is often seen as 'the American technique'.

                The basis of NTS's biomechanical efficiency is using the archer's bone structure and back muscles to brace the weight of the bow. Aligning the archer's bone structure is paramount in any archery discipline, not just NTS. To achieve this, the archer must align their bow wrist, bow elbow, both shoulders and draw elbow in a perfect line that points at the target downrange. With all major bones in the system aligned, the force of the bow is braced by the bones instead of the muscles. This allows the relevant muscles to relax and allow the archer to execute a clean shot. The hallmark of NTS is direct, active back muscle engagement on the draw side of the archer. While other techniques use the lower and middle trapezi as supporting peripheral muscles, NTS encourages archers to actively engage and contract those muscles to expand through the clicker. The aim of using the back muscles is so that the archer can relax the muscles in their draw arm, shoulder, and fingers. The process of redistributing the draw tension in an archer's body from the draw arm to the back muscles is dubbed 'transfer'. Once again, relaxation of the muscles in the draw arm and fingers allows for a cleaner release and therefore a more accurate shot. According to Lee, an added bonus of this technique is that it allows the archer to expand through the clicker without changing the tension in their draw arm. Instead, the archer expands through the clicker exclusively with their back muscles, with the draw arm tension remains constant. While it is important to have minimal tension in the draw arm and fingers, it is even more important for that tension (however much) to be consistent every time. This is the only way to have consistent groups downrange.

                As I discussed before, the biomechanical principles of NTS can be seen in other techniques as well. But what makes NTS so distinctive? How can experienced archers instantly tell if you have been training with KiSik Lee? The answer to this question is an angular draw. The principles of using the bone structure and back tension refer only to when the archer is at full draw, right before they are about to release the arrow. Angular draw refers to the way in which the archer reaches this position. This is by way the most distinctive yet controversial feature of NTS. In conventional shooting methods (Korean Push-Pull), the 'bone line' is mostly formed before the archer lifts the bow. Then, the archer pulls the bow straight back (linear draw) to their anchor point. However, linear draw puts the archer's draw shoulder in a very awkward position. At high draw weights (45lb+) and elite level daily arrow counts (500+), this is a recipe for eventual rotator cuff injury. So, Lee's idea of angular draw appears to solve this problem. The archer begins with his shoulders wide to the target, the 'bone line' not very well-formed at the beginning of the shot. However, as the archer is drawing, the entire upper torso is rotated into alignment. This 'coiling' during the draw instead of before protects the shoulder and is supposed to eliminate must rotator cuff injuries. However, I can only speculate on why this technique is not adopted universally. Firstly, the coiling motion during the draw is directly counteractive to archery's core tenet: consistency. An archer shooting linear technique knows his shoulders are aligned the same way every shot. However, another archer using angular draw must rotate his shoulders exactly the same amount each shot. This is considerably harder to master and can create draw length inconsistencies, devastating to a recurve archer. Another glaring flaw is that NTS appears to need more effort/tension to draw the bow. This flaw counteracts the whole point of NTS: making shooting easier on the body. Rotating the upper torso while keeping the hips in place creates a lot of tension in the core. Tension in the core easily translates to the arms and shoulders, creating a tight and forced shot. For this reason, the NTS method, unfortunately, appears to have limited success with smaller female athletes. The US women have been struggling to put out a true international competitor for many years since adopting NTS as the national standard. The US's two top female prospects (who use NTS) in recent years are Mackenzie Brown and Khatuna Lorig, 5x Olympian (Georgia). Both these women are incredibly strong, pulling more draw weight than the male average in the Olympics. Both Brown and Lorig also have very long draw lengths, especially Brown at 5'10". The current top-ranked female in the US, Casey Kaufhold, shoots a relaxed, hybrid style more reminiscent of push-pull than American NTS.
