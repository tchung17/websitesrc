                Although I am in self-proclaimed "retirement" from competitive archery, I have been eyeing a comeback for quite some time. There are no excuses from here on out- I have finally managed to find a way to practice on campus, which is a true game-changer. Getting those consistent reps in has helped me stay in shape enough to shoot my heavy competition bow. I am still shooting my tried and true Win&Win setup dating back to the 2014 US Open. In fact, dating back two days before the US Open. In 2014 I had only been shooting for under a year and did not have the simple wisdom to not buy a bow and redo my entire setup and tune two days before the biggest competition of the year. All I remember was not shooting well the week before the competition. Instead of looking to my form for the fix, I decided something was wrong with the bow I had at the time (it was fine).

                Since I am looking to compete in smaller local shoots, for the time being, I am taking this extended break period to work on my form and physical strength/endurance. While I can tell that my form has floated around throughout the years, I can still use my own proprioception to make subtle changes. I've also watched enough televised archery to pick apart any archer's form and apply it to my own. Currently, I am recommitting to my fundamentals. I've noticed that my fingers hooking the string have a tendency to loosen up as I draw the bow. As the hook becomes shallower, I have to put more tension on my fingers to keep the string from slipping away. If I can fix this issue permanently, I can have a more relaxed and consistent draw hand. Also, I'm hoping to work on my clicker reflex, which I have managed to get away with for my entire archery career. Most archers have conditioned their clicker response so that it isn't a full reflex. In other words, when they draw through the clicker, they have the presence of mind to either a. subconsciously execute their release or b. abort the shot and let down. However, I have let releasing when the clicker clicks become a reflex burned into my mind for six years.
