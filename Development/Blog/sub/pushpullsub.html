                While the push-pull method and its subvariants are widely used throughout the world, its true patron is Korea. Korea has dominated the archery world since a women's gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, where legendary coach Hyung-tak Kim took control of the Korean archery program. His method is also unmistakable. The archer is encouraged to push the bow with their bow hand while simultaneously pulling with the other, creating a sort of 50/50 balance. This balance results in stability and ultimately consistency downrange. While his archers use a linear draw, they still manage to achieve perfect alignment and peripheral back engagement. Interestingly, his students have long careers without any repeating rotator cuff injuries. Perhaps the greatest property of Korean push-pull shooters is the strict beauty of their forms. The Korean archery program is notoriously unforgiving and therefore produces archers with the most technically correct and visually appealing techniques in the world. It is said that making the Korean national team is far more difficult than a podium finish on the international stage. A prime example is in the most important part of the shot: the release. Renowned Korean names such as Kim Woojin and Ki-Bo-Bae (pictured) are synonymous with the crispest and picturesque releases in memory. Their fingers, while holding in excess of 45lbs of draw weight, appear to release the string effortlessly and without any tension. Ki's fingers don't appear to open at all unless you watch in 1000fps slow motion.

                While the Korean archery technique is simpler and easier to learn at first, most of their teachings focus on the archer's internal state. The subtle tensions, balances, and mindsets that are impossible to discern without communicating with the archer. So, I view push-pull as a technique that is easy to learn but takes 10 years (10,000) hours of training to begin to master. With push-pull archers, more emphasis is put on the mental game (software over hardware) during competitions. Kim Woojin, the previous world record holder, called his shot in the 2016 Rio Olympics. The year before that Olympics, he proclaimed that he would best the then-world-record of 699/720. During the qualification round, he scored 700/720. I would imagine that Kim accomplished this Jordan-esque feat through a strict regimen of visualization, and self-affirmation work. However, the premier training techniques of Korea are a well-kept secret to their top private clubs and national programs. This only adds to the mystique of the highly imposing and accomplished Korean archery team.
