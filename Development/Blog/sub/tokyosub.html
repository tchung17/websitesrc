                Even though 2016 still feels like yesterday, Olympic hopefuls have been diligently counting the days until Tokyo 2020. For the United States men, Brady Ellison is a household name that appears on podiums year after year, and to no surprise, will attend his fourth Olympics this summer. In Rio 2016, Ellison was the individual Bronze medalist and a team Silver medalist. His 2019 outdoor season was nothing short of remarkable. A new, seemingly unattainable world record of 702/720, multiple stage wins, and World Archery Champion to top it off. If we are going off recent memory, Brady Ellison is an obvious choice for an Olympic podium this cycle. The USA once again has a young hopeful in the Recurve Men's division, 20-year-old Jack Williams. I've known him since JDT Selection Camp in 2014, and he now attends the Resident Athlete program in Chula Vista, California. He has not stopped improving since I first met him, and has recently bested Brady Ellison in a few head-to-head matchups. However, the US Men's bread and butter -the team round- is not looking too hopeful this Olympic cycle. They are clearly missing a clear third option, and with only two consistent elite performers, their medal hopes are slim in the Team rounds. This weakness in the USA's third option is only highlighted by the rapidly rising Chinese Taipei men's team and the legendary, consistent, year after year performance of the Korean men's team. The Korean men took the Gold in Rio 2016, and are very well-positioned to defend their title.

                On the other side of the line, the US women also appear to have a promising new hope in 15-year-old Casey Kaufhold. She is ranked #1 in the US, above seasoned Olympic veterans Mackenzie Brown and Khatuna Lorig. Kaufhold has recently broken countless national and world Junior records, with many more to come. However, the US women as a whole have struggled in international competition. The women are unlikely to qualify for a full 3-person Olympic squad, and will likely send Kaufhold alone. While Kaufhold is relatively untested on the international stage, her outings have been impressive and show great potential. However, at 15, she has no Olympic experience, and we can only observe how she adapts her mental game to this pressure.
